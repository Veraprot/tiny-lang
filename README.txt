Welcome to tiny programming language.

This is an example to study how interperters work and build another one.

To use, execute the `run` executable.

The default file to send is test.tl. You can use another one running manualy.

  $ gcc interperter.c -o interperter

  $ ./interperter ./path/to/file.tl

Feel free to contribute!!
