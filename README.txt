Welcome to tiny programming language.

This is an example to study how interperters work and build new one.

To use, execute the run executable.

The default file to send is examples/full.tl. You can use another one running manualy.

  g++  ../src/**/*.cpp ../src/*.cpp  -o interpreter

  ./interpreter ../path/file.tl

test/programs/ has some examples that what this programming language can do.

Feel free to contribute!!
